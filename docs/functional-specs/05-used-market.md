# 05 - Used Vehicle Market

## Overview

The used market is a game system that offers used vehicles at reduced prices. This section allows viewing and editing the vehicles currently for sale on this market.

## Vehicles for Sale List

### Display
Each vehicle for sale is displayed with:
- **Vehicle name** (derived from the XML path)
- **Current sale price**
- **Age** (in in-game days)
- **Wear** (percentage, 0% = new, 100% = heavily worn)
- **Damage** (percentage)
- **Usage time** (in hours)
- **Time remaining** before removal from sale (in in-game days)
- **Origin**: automatically generated by the game or listed for sale by the player

## Editing a Vehicle for Sale

### Simple Mode
- **Price**: edit the vehicle's sale price
- **Time remaining**: extend or reduce the time the vehicle is available for sale
- **Wear**: edit the wear level (0 = new, 1 = fully worn)
- **Damage**: edit the damage level (0 = none, 1 = destroyed)

### Advanced Mode
- **Age**: edit the displayed age of the vehicle
- **Usage time**: edit the hours counter
- **Purchased configuration**: view the vehicle's configuration (color, options)

## Quick Actions

- **"Reset to New"**: sets wear and damage to 0, age to 0, hours to 0
- **"Bargain Price"**: reduces the price to 10% of its current value
- **"Extend Sale"**: adds 30 days of availability

## Removing a Vehicle from the Market

> Note: as with owned vehicles, adding new vehicles to the market is not supported in the MVP for the same reasons of complexity and integrity.
